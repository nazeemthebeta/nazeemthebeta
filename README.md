I'm Nazeem ✨ I am a final year electrical engineering student of University of Moratuwa. Other than coding i like to read which is why i co-founded [FathimaBooks.com](https://fathimabooks.com/) and [Ghazal Publications](https://ghazal.press). 

🔭 I am currently working on my final year undergraduate project, which is to create an offline Home Automation System with built-in Audio Recognition and Intention Detection. 

🌱 I am currenlty learning about deep learning and voice activity detection. 

⚡ Fun fact: I am doing freelancing on web development, graphic designing and video making. \n
